To put this into perspective, let’s compare it with existing solutions like Zelle, Venmo, and traditional bank transfers:Zelle and Venmo: These platforms are popular for domestic transfers within the United States but are limited to fiat currencies and do not support international transactions without additional fees.
Traditional Bank Transfers: International bank transfers can take several days and incur high fees, especially for smaller amounts.
Coinbase’s New Feature: Offers instant, borderless transactions with no fees, using a stablecoin that maintains a 1:1 peg with the US dolla
